gest you take a look
at [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) or the other great solutions out there.

How to Use
---

Write your HTML as you would normaly:
    
```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Something to be held in place" />
```

Then you simply have to target each types of inputs/textarea you will use:

```javascript
$('textarea[placeholder]').simplePlaceholder();
$('input:text[placeholder]').simplePlaceholder(); // classic input[type=text]
$('input:email[placeholder]').simpleIf you want to customize the appearance of the text used as placeholder, 
there is a class added to the field that you can use. It defaults to `placeholding` but you can override it:

```javascript
$('textarea[placeholder]').simplePlaceholder({ placeholderClass: "MyCustomClass" });
```
